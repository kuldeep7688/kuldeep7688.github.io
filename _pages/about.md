Hello, and welcome to my website! I am Kuldeep Singh, a second-year Masters in Data Science student at the [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/), East Lansing. Prior to this, I completed my bachelor’s in Civil Engineering at [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/). With a keen interest in **Natural Language Processing**, my research focuses on **information retrieval techniques, knowledge base construction, healthcare applications of NLP**. I am currently exploring the nuances of **factual accuracy, calibration, and controllability in large language models**, alongside delving into **Open Domain Question Answering**.

Currently, I am engaged in collaborative projects with Professors [Ling Wang](https://medicine.chm.msu.edu/directory/wang-l.html) and [Jiayu Zhou](https://jiayuzhou.github.io/). With Professor Wang, I am working on Bert and LLM-based methodologies to evaluate medical student patient notes and investigate biases within clerkship comments. Moreover, my work with Professor Zhou on a survey paper on Open Domain Question Answering is slated for publication in ACM. My master’s capstone project, under the guidance of Professor [Mohammad Ghassemi](https://engineering.msu.edu/faculty/Mohammad-Ghassemi), focussed on developing a novel methodology for predicting funding flows in public and private markets, aiming to revolutionize funding flow predictions through interdisciplinary data integration.


During summer 2023, I was AI Research Summer Associate Intern at [JP Morgan & Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/). I worked under [Simerjot Kaur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simerjot-kaur-3429ab2a/) and [Charese Smiley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V2UiOeoAAAAJ&hl=en). The focus of my reaserch was on building a financial question answering system on annual reports using Large Language Models with SOTA performance on FinQA. 

Prior to my master's I worked at [ConcertAI](https://www.concertai.com/), Bengaluru and [Innoplexus Consulting Pvt. Ltd.](https://www.innoplexus.com/), Pune. At ConcertAI, I developed information extraction models for Electronic Healthcare Data of cancer patients, incorporating SkWeak and Snorkel methods into the training data creation pipeline. At Innoplexus, I specialized in building NER and Relationship Classification models on biomedical data, alongside constructing a biomedical knowledge base for drug discovery pipelines.
