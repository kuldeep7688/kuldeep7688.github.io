## Description
Pytorch implementation of Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network for Text Classification. This is a simple pytorch implmentation of dynamic convolutional neural network as presented in the paper A Convolutional Neural Network for Modelling Sentences by Kalchbrenner et al. [Paper for DCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2188v1).
