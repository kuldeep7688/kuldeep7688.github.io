## Description
Implementation of the Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. This is a simple pytorch implmentation of very deep convolutional networks as presented in the paper Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Text Classification by Yann Le Cun et al. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01781?context=cs).
