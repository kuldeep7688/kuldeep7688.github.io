## Description
This project was done under MSU AI Club and was awarded Best Use Of AI, MSU AI Hackathon. 
We developed a browser extension which will take the selected text on a website as input and create a concept map out of it. This project is aimed at providing an alternative way to represent information metioned text as a graph for easier interpretation.
